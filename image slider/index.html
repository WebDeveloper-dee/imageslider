            <h1>Anime</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p>Anime is a style of animation popular in Japanese films and 
                television series. It often combines stark, colorful graphics 
                with action-packed plots. Early anime films were intended 
                primarily for a Japanese audience. Therefore, they used many 
                cultural references unique to Japan.</p>

            <h1>More about Anime</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p>Anime (アニメ) is a Japanese term for hand-drawn or computer 
                animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of 
                "animation" in Japanese, where this term references all 
                animation. Outside Japan, anime is used to refer specifically 
                to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation
                style.</p>

            <p>During a mission, Sasuke awakens his Sharingan — his clan's

                to learn imperceptible movements at a superhuman rate. It is 
                revealed later that Sasuke is the sole survivor of the 
                once-powerful Uchiha clan of Konohagakure.</p>
